This prolly be my last effort onto 
showing you... how much I love you.
Happy Birthday, Raiver.
ã‚·
I wish today can be as incredible as you are.
This may feel somewhat uncomfortable, and
I know you no longer needed but, I might as well do it. 
Promise, this will be the last time you'll ever hear, see,
anything from me.
Happy Birthday to you, an amazing human being whose 
soul's worth to love. You're one of the
best experience I would always run back to.
I may not be able to do this forever, 
know that I'll always remember 
this day as somewhat special in my heart. 
I wish for you to continue doing what you love, 
especially when it makes your heart filled with happiness.
(seeing you happy, is what i seek for)

As long as I'm here, you'll have someone 
who's proud of you in everything you do. 
Not physically, but, you knew exactly where, my love.
You brings so much light in someone's life, 
don't ever lose your hope in yourself, I believed in you. 
I'll be here always and forever, for you. 
I'm wishing you all the best in life.
Happiest Birthday to you, My once, Vel>

Forever yours,
     Z.A
